# Microcontroller-Embedded-Driver-Development

This repository documents my progress through the **FastBit Embedded Systems course** on mastering low-level driver development using STM32 microcontrollers. I'm learning how to develop bare-metal drivers by directly accessing peripheral registers without relying on vendor libraries like HAL or CMSIS.

## What I'm Learning

- ARM Cortex-M architecture and startup flow
- Writing startup code and linker scripts
- GPIO driver from scratch
- SPI, I2C, USART driver development
- NVIC and EXTI configuration
- Writing interrupt handlers
- Debugging at the register level


## Tools & Enivorment

- Microcontroller: STM32F103RB
- IDE: STM32CubeIDE
- Language: C
- Build Toolchain: ARM GCC

##  Goals

- Understand low-level driver development
- Gain confidence with linker scripts and startup code
- Build a solid foundation for RTOS, Bare Metal, and IoT firmware
